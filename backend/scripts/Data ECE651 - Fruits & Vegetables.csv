They are all sweet and juicy with a crisp flesh and watery texture. Sliced watermelon tastes great on its own, or you can toss watermelon cubes with some feta cheese and fresh mint for a summer salad"

Inside, their green flesh is speckled with tiny black edible seeds and their flavour is sweet and sometimes tart. You can peel and slice your kiwi or just cut it in half and scoop out the flesh with a spoon. They retain their bright green colour even when exposed to air so kiwi is a good choice for fruit salad and fresh fruit tarts."
